# Carousel Prototype
CodePath iOS for Designers: Week Two

Spent about 10 hours.

All the basics, a lot of the optionals plus:

* Made the scrubber in the feed view work: can drag scrubber and move feed or drag feed and move scrubber
* Added a (Carousel-like) detail view for an example photo with conditional pan behavior to return to the feed view
